# Database

Learn more about Notion's database object.

A **database** is an object that contains one or more [data sources](ref:data-sources). Databases can either be displayed inline in the parent page (`is_inline: true`) or as a full page (`is_inline: false`). The properties (schema) of each data source under a database can be maintained independently, and each data source has its own set of rows (pages).

Individual data sources don't have permissions settings, so the set of Notion users and bots that have access to data source children is managed through **databases**.

Databases that exist at the workspace level must be full-page databases, not inline. For easier permission management, we typically recommend having at least one level of parent page in between a database and the top-level workspace root.
